# sudokusolver
A simple Java program to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.

## Usage

1. Modify the `board` array in the `main` method to represent the Sudoku puzzle you want to solve. Use `0` to represent empty cells.

2. Run the program:

   ```sh
   javac SudokuSolver.java
   java SudokuSolver

**Note:
- This program uses a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently.
- The program attempts to solve the puzzle as long as there's a valid solution. It will backtrack if necessary.
- The board array represents the Sudoku grid, where 0 indicates an empty cell.
- The program will print the solved puzzle to the console or indicate if the puzzle is unsolvable.
